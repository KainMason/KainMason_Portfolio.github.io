  <p>
    Welcome! These featured projects highlight my work in full-stack development,
    data engineering, visualization, and secure, well-documented system design.
    This portfolio is being actively built and refined as part of my CS-499
    Computer Science Capstone.

  <!-- Featured Artifacts -->
  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color:#333;">Featured Artifacts</h3>
  <ul>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <strong>Software Design &amp; Engineering:</strong>
      <a href="https://github.com/KainMason/CS465-Final-Project" target="_blank">
        Travlr Getaways – MEAN Stack Application
      </a>
      &mdash; a full-stack travel booking system using Node.js, Express,
      MongoDB, Handlebars, and an Angular admin SPA. This project is my primary
      Software Design &amp; Engineering artifact for CS-499 and is currently being
      enhanced and refactored as part of my capstone milestones.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures:</strong>
      <a href="https://github.com/KainMason/C330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization"
         target="_blank">
        3D Desk Scene – C++ / OpenGL
      </a>
      &mdash; a graphics project using custom geometry algorithms, lighting, and
      hierarchical rendering. This artifact demonstrates applied math,
      transformations, and structured code to manage complexity.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <strong>Databases &amp; System Design:</strong>
      <a href="https://github.com/KainMason/CS-340-8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Item"
         target="_blank">
        Grazioso Salvare – MongoDB Rescue Dashboard
      </a>
      &mdash; a Python + Dash dashboard for filtering and visualizing animal
      rescue data. Focus areas include data modeling, CRUD operations, basic
      indexing considerations, and building a simple analytics-style UI.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <!-- CS-499 Progress Section -->
  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; color:#333;">CS-499 Progress (Milestone Two)</h3>
  <p>
    For <strong>Milestone Two</strong>, I focused on enhancing the
    <em>Travlr Getaways</em> project as my Software Design &amp; Engineering artifact.
    The goal was not just to have working code, but to improve the structure,
    maintainability, and clarity of the application so it looks and feels more
    like something used in a real development environment.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; color:#444;">Key Enhancements Completed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Refactored backend structure:</strong> Separated routing, controllers,
      and configuration into clearer folders and removed duplicated logic to make
      the API easier to follow and maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improved error handling:</strong> Added more consistent API responses
      and status codes so failures are easier to debug and less confusing to clients.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cleaned up MongoDB queries:</strong> Standardized query patterns and
      removed unused or redundant queries to keep the data access layer predictable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enhanced documentation:</strong> Expanded the README with setup steps,
      technology stack details, and a short architecture overview so a new developer
      or hiring manager can quickly understand how the system fits together.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Front-end layout tweaks:</strong> Made small consistency improvements
      to the customer-facing pages to keep the UI more readable and aligned across views.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These changes support the CS-499 outcomes around software engineering/design,
    communication, and developing a security-aware mindset. I am still iterating,
    but this represents my current level of progress in the course.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across all projects, I focus on writing clear, maintainable code, documenting
    my decisions, and building solutions that would actually be usable in a real
    environment, not just as class assignments.
