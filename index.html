  <p>
    Welcome! These are a few featured projects that highlight my skills in
    full-stack development, data work, and secure, well-documented system design.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Software Design &amp; Engineering:</strong>
      <a href="#" target="_blank">
        Travlr Getaways MEAN Stack Application
      </a>
      &mdash; a full-stack travel booking site built with Node.js, Express,
      MongoDB, Handlebars, and an Angular admin SPA. I refactored the routing
      and controllers, improved error handling, and expanded the README so a new
      developer (or hiring manager) can quickly understand the architecture and
      how to run the app.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures:</strong>
      <a href="https://github.com/KainMason/C330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization" target="_blank">
        3D Desk Scene
      </a>
      &mdash; a C++ / OpenGL project that uses custom geometry-building logic
      and hierarchical rendering to create a 3D desk environment. This project
      shows how I work with lower-level math, transformations, and structured
      code to manage complexity.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Databases &amp; System Design:</strong>
      <a href="https://github.com/KainMason/CS-340-8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Item" target="_blank">
        Grazioso Salvare MongoDB Rescue Dashboard
      </a>
      &mdash; a Python + Dash application backed by MongoDB that filters and
      visualizes animal rescue data. This artifact focuses on data modeling,
      query design, and building a small analytics-style dashboard with a
      clean, task-focused UI.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Across these projects, I focus on writing clear, maintainable code,
    documenting my decisions, and building things that would actually be usable
    in a real environment.
